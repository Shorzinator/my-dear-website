            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Shourya Maheshwari. I'm a data scientist with a passion for turning data into product, 
                insights into actions, and bridging the gap between IT and business. With a strong background in ETL design, 
                managing databases, data mining, analysis, and visualization, 
                I'm always looking for ways to bring data to life.
